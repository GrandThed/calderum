# Calderum Project

## Project Overview
A magical potion brewing board game app inspired by PÃ³cimas y Brebajes, built with Flutter and Firebase.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Flutter (Dart SDK 3.4.1)
- **State Management**: Riverpod (flutter_riverpod, riverpod_annotation)
- **Routing**: go_router
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage)
- **Code Generation**: freezed, json_serializable, build_runner
- **Architecture**: MVVM with feature-based structure

## Project Structure
```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ features/           # Feature modules
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ account/       # Authentication & user management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ home/          # Home view and navigation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ room/          # Game room management
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/            # Shared components and utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ router.dart        # App routing configuration
â””â”€â”€ main.dart          # Entry point
```

## Key Commands
```bash
# Generate code (freezed models, riverpod providers)
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Watch for changes and generate
dart run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Run the app
flutter run

# Run tests
flutter test

# Format code
dart format .

# Analyze code
flutter analyze
```

## Current Status
- Authentication system being migrated to Firebase
- Room management system in development
- Using Riverpod for state management
- Custom UI components with Caudex and Caveat fonts

## Environment Setup
- Requires Firebase configuration files (`google-services.json` for Android, `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS)
- Uses flutter_dotenv for additional environment configuration

## Development Notes
- Models use freezed for immutability and code generation
- ViewModels use riverpod_generator for dependency injection
- Follow feature-based folder structure
- All generated files use `.g.dart` and `.freezed.dart` extensions
- Update any change into the mcp server

## MCP Server Setup
The project uses Dart's native MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for AI-assisted development.

### Auto-start on Development
**IMPORTANT**: Always start the MCP server at the beginning of each development session:
```bash
# Windows
start_dev.bat

# Or manually start MCP server
dart mcp-server
```

### Configuration
- MCP configuration is in `.mcp.json`
- The server provides intelligent code assistance for Dart/Flutter development
- Automatically syncs with project changes for context-aware suggestions

### Development Workflow
1. Start MCP server first (via `start_dev.bat` or manually)
2. Make code changes - MCP server will track them
3. Use AI assistance for code generation, refactoring, and debugging
4. MCP server stops automatically when development session ends

## Firebase Security Setup ðŸ”’
The project implements secure Firebase credential management to protect sensitive API keys.

### Security Implementation
- **Environment Variables**: All Firebase credentials stored in `.env` file
- **Version Control**: `.env` file excluded from Git via `.gitignore`
- **Example Template**: `.env.example` shows required structure without sensitive values
- **Secure Initialization**: `firebase_options_secure.dart` loads credentials from environment

### Setup Instructions
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in your actual Firebase credentials in `.env`
3. Use `main_secure.dart` for secure Firebase initialization
4. **NEVER** commit `.env` to version control

### Security Best Practices
- Regularly rotate Firebase API keys
- Use Firebase Security Rules to restrict database access
- Enable Firebase App Check for additional security
- Monitor Firebase usage for suspicious activity
- Never commit `.env` file to version control
- Use different Firebase projects for development/staging/production

### Files Overview
- `.env` - Contains sensitive Firebase credentials (excluded from Git)
- `.env.example` - Template showing required environment variables
- `firebase_options_secure.dart` - Secure Firebase options using environment variables
- `main.dart` - Entry point with secure Firebase initialization
